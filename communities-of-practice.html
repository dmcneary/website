        <p>
            Communities of Practice started at Hack for LA in 2020, post-Covid. 
            These communities have been a vital connection point in our fully remote 
            organization. They have enabled us to connect people across projects in 
            ways that are both meaningful for the individuals, and have helped the 
            organization build professional infrastructure to support our community, 
            nonprofit and government project partnerships. These communities have 
            also enabled Hack for LA to provide rapid response to the evolving 
            crises of 2020.
